                            <p class="section_box2_div_div2_box_text_p11">The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest mosque in Southeast Asia, can accommodate up to 200,000 worshipers at a time, making it one of the largest mosques in the world. Not only is the size impressive, the architectural design of this mosque is also stunning, with the shape of the walls and pillars that characterize this mosque.

                            <p>Uniquely, the mosque whose name means "Independence" in Arabic is the result of a design competition held in 1955. The architect was Frederich Silaban, and this mosque took 12 years to build until it was finally inaugurated in 1978.
